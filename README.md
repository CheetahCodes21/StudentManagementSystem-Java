## Overview

The Student Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage student information for educational institutions. It allows users to add new students, record their grades, and retrieve their average grade.

## Features

- Add Student: Users can input the name and ID of a new student, and the system will create a student object with an empty grade list.

- Record Grades: Users can add grades for existing students. The system will calculate the average grade automatically.

- Display Student Information: Users can retrieve and display a student's name, ID, and average grade by entering the student's ID.

- Command-Line Interface: The system operates through a simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher is required to run the application.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentManagementSystem-Java.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd StudentManagementSystem-Java
```

### Usage

1. Compile the Java files:

```bash
javac StudentManagementSystem.java
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
java StudentManagementSystem
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the Student Management System.

## How It Works

- The main entry point of the application is the `StudentManagementSystem` class, which contains the `main` method.

- The `Student` class represents a student and has properties like name, ID, and a list of grades.

- Users can add new students and record their grades through the `addStudent` and `addGrade` methods in the `StudentManagementSystem` class.

- The `displayStudentInfo` method retrieves a student's information, calculates their average grade, and displays it.
